# Neovim config

## Installation

> first of all, make sure you have the latest neovim version installed.

- If you're already using neovim, it is a good idea to make a backup of your current configuration.

- Clear current config.
```

# Linux / Macos (unix)

rm -rf ~/.config/nvim
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim

```

- Clone this repo to your neovim config dir.
```

# Linux / Macos (unix)
git clone "https://github.com/voitaraujo/nvim-config.git" ~/.config/nvim

```

Aight, you're good to go!
